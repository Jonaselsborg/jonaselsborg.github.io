# Hej! :wave: Who am I?

I am a **protein biochemist and proteomics researcher** based in Oxford, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating post-translational modifications. My research investigates how dynamic modifications such as ADP-ribosylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination coordinate protein function in response to cellular stress. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford with the [Ahel group](https://ivanahellab.wixsite.com/ivan-ahel-lab); I'm also affiliated with the [Olsen group](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/proteomics/olsen/) at the Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen.  

 My main expertise is **mass spectrometry** — from sample prep and LC-MS analysis to downstream data processing. Despite this, I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades type of scientist; this means I easily get excited about different areas of science and different techniques. I love to connect knowledge from different disciplines to address bold questions in new ways. Outside the lab, I am passionate about analog photography, including darkroom printing (_yes, more lab work_).

I use this website to share projects I am working on and to write reflections on topics that catch my interest.

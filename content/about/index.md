# Hej! :wave: Who am I?

 I am a **protein biochemist and proteomics researcher** based in Oxford, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating post-translational modifications. My research investigates how dynamic modifications such as ADP-ribosylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination coordinate protein function in response to cellular stress. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at University of Oxford with the [Ahel group](https://ivanahellab.wixsite.com/ivan-ahel-lab); I'm also affiniliated with the [Olsen group](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/research/proteomics/olsen/) at Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen. 

I am a jack-of-all-trades type of scientist; this means I easily get excited about different areas of science and different techniques. I love to connect knowledge from different diciplines to adress bold questions in new ways. My main expertise is mass **mass spectrometry**; from sample prep, LC-MS analysis to downstream data processing. Outside the lab, Ii am passionate about analog photography including darkroom printing (_yes, more lab work_).

I use this website to share about projects I am working on, and to write reflections on topics which I feel would be of interest to others.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Molecular Mechanisms of Disease at Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen, under the supervision of [Michael L. Nielsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellundnielsen/). My thesis focused on understanding the functional role of **PARP1 auto-modification**, you can read more about this work [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276525007476?via%3Dihub).

With 7 years of hands-on experience, my main specialty is **mass spectrometry**; from sample prep, LC-MS analysis to downstream data processing. What i love the most about this work is its diversity:
- The _sample prep side_ allows me to work closely with biological systems and study their complex phenotypes
- The _LC-MS side_ allows me to focus on technical aspects of intrumentation, including method optimisation
- The _data processing side_ allows me to dive deep into complex datasets and explore statistics, bioinformatics, and programming

Outside the lab, i am passionate about analog photography including darkroom printing (_yes, more lab work_). It is really gratifying (and difficult) to be in control of each step of the photographic process.  -->

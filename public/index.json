[{"content":"\rHej! \u0026#x1f44b; Who am I?\r#\rI am a protein biochemist and proteomics researcher based in Oxford, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating post-translational modifications. My research investigates how dynamic modifications such as ADP-ribosylation, SUMOylation, and ubiquitination coordinate protein function in response to cellular stress. I\u0026rsquo;m a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford with the Ahel group; I\u0026rsquo;m also affiliated with the Olsen group at the Center for Protein Research, University of Copenhagen.\nI am a jack-of-all-trades type of scientist; this means I easily get excited about different areas of science and different techniques. I love to connect knowledge from different disciplines to address bold questions in new ways. My main expertise is mass spectrometry â€” from sample prep and LC-MS analysis to downstream data processing. Outside the lab, I am passionate about analog photography, including darkroom printing (yes, more lab work).\nI use this website to share projects I am working on and to write reflections on topics that I feel might be of interest to others.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Jonas D.
